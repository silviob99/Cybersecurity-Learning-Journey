A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings. A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language. This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

Responsibilities
Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
