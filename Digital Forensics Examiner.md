If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect job. If you are working as part of a law-enforcement department, you would be focused on collecting and analysing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the guilty and exonerating the innocent. On the other hand, if your work falls under defending a company's network, you will be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents, such as policy violations.

Responsibilities
Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
Document your findings and report on the case
